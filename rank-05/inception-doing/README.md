# Inception (doing)

This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.

Here, a scheme of the links between the various files. We'll look at them in more detail later. But typically, this is what your inception should look like:

Let's try to understand each term and see what each project file should contain :) Let's go!
