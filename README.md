# What is this gitbook for?

The goal is to explain (almost) each project of the 42 program and our reasoning from A-Z to find a solution. We still invite you to try to do the projects by yourself because that's how you will learn best.&#x20;

Use this Gitbook only to understand some notions you are missing or when you are stuck ;) By copying and pasting a code you won't learn much.



PS: We started our cursus on October 24, 2022. **If something is out of date, wrong or unclear don't hesitate** [**to tell us**](team.md) **and we will change it in the next few days.**

**-----**

**PSS : THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR FEEDBACKS <3**&#x20;

We receive dozens of messages every week on linkedin, github or by e-mail that make us really happy. So we wanted to so THANK YOU. Don't hesitate to let us know what you'd like to see in this gitbook and to leave a kind message to us, from all around the world.&#x20;



Have fun !

Laura & Simon, from Switzerland (42 Lausanne)
