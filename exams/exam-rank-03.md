# Exam Rank 03

This exam a little less complicated than the first one you did. Just do one of the two exercises you come across, and you're done.&#x20;

Here are the two exercises you may be asked to do:

* [ft\_printf](../rank-01/ft_printf/)
  * This one is pretty simple, you need to implement only a part of the conversion from the original printf: `%x`, `%s` and `%d`. Pretty easy.
* [get\_next\_line](../rank-01/get_next_line/)
  * A while back, this exercise wasn't compile with the `-D BUFFER_SIZE` flag, so it could be done on three (3) lines of code. But the subject changed, and now you have to build a complete `get_next_line`.

Ant that's it ! Well... we won't lie to each other. If you get printf it's very fast and easy :smile:  But if you get `get_next_line`, good luck ;)
