# ðŸ“„ Makefiles

### Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
I will mainly use the term _executable_ in the following examples, note that Makefiles can also be used to create a library.\
The steps to create a Makefile for a library are described later in this page.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that if you copy paste a Makefile example from this gitbook, you'll have to change every 4 spaces tabs, to single tabs as gitbook automatically converts a tab to a 4 spaces tab.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll need a Makefile for alot of 42 projects, I think it's better if you understand what it does and how to modify it rather than just copying it from a Github.
{% endhint %}

### What is a Makefile / make ?

Makefiles are basically sophisticated shell scripts that automate the repetitive tasks of compiling/recompiling many files.&#x20;

Make Is a Unix utility that is designed to start execution of a makefile.\
A Makefile is a special file that you create name _Makefile_, it contains shell commands. While in the directory containing this Makefile, you will run the _make_ command and the commands written in the Makefile will be executed.

Make keeps track of the last time files (normally object files) were updated and only updates those files which are required to keep the sourcefile up-to-date.\
If you have a program with a lot of source and/or header files, when you change a file on which others depend, you must recompile all the dependent files. This is an extremely time-consuming task.

A Makefile contains a list of _rules_.\
These rules tell the system what commands you want to execute. Most of the time, these rules are commands to compile, or recompile, a series of files.&#x20;

The rules are in two parts. The first line is called a _dependency line_ and the following line(s) are called _actions_ or _commands_. The action line(s) must be indented with a tab.

Rule syntax:

```
RULE: DEPENDENCY LINE
    [tab]ACTION LINE(S)
```

The dependency line is also made of two parts. The first part, before the colon, is the _target_ file and the second part, after the colon, are the _prerequisites._ \
It is called a _dependency line_ because the first part depends on the second part.\
Multiple _prerequisites_ files must be separated by a space.

After the Makefile has been created, a program can be (re)compiled by typing _make._ _Make_ then reads the Makefile, creates a dependency tree and take whatever action is necessary.\
It will not necessarily do all the rules in the Makefile as all dependencies may not need to be updated. It will rebuild _target_ files if they are missing or older than the dependency file(s).

Unless directed otherwise, make will stop when it encounters an error during the build process.

### Simple Makefile example

Let's start of with the following three files, _hello.c, hellofunc.c_ and _hello.h._

<details>

<summary>hello.c</summary>

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```c
#include "hello.h"

int    main(void)
{
    printHello(void);

    return (0);
}
```
{% endcode %}

</details>

<details>

<summary>hellofunc.c</summary>

<pre class="language-c" data-overflow="wrap" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-c"><strong>#include "hello.h"
</strong>
void    printHello(void)
{
    printf("Hello World!\n);
}
</code></pre>

</details>

<details>

<summary>hello.h</summary>

```c
#ifndef HELLO_H
# define HELLO_H
# include <stdio.h>

void    printHello(void);
#endif
```

</details>

Normally, you would compile these files by executing the following command :\
`gcc -Wextra -Wall -Werror hello.c hellofunc.c -I. -o hello`

{% hint style="info" %}
The `-I.` is included so that gcc wil look in the current directory (.) for the include file _hello.h_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This command compiles the two .c files and creates an executable named _hello_.

The simplest Makefile you could create for these file would look something like :

{% code title="Makefile" lineNumbers="true" %}
```makefile
hello: hello.c hellofunc.c
    gcc -Wextra -Wall -Werror hello.c hellofunc.c -I. -o hello
```
{% endcode %}

Next, I will describe what rules are present in every Makefiles, these are conventions rules, and are required by the 42 Norm.

More complex Makefile will be described later.

### Rules conventions

As said above, there are some rules conventions, these are rules that are not mandatory but present in almost all Makefiles, this makes compiling and building, as well as cleaning easier. Plus, these rules are required in the 42 Norm.

<table><thead><tr><th width="203">Rule name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>all</td><td>Since the first rule encountered in the Makefile is executed when using the <code>make</code> command without any specific rule, the <em>all</em> rule has to be placed first in the Makefile, it usually calls the $(NAME) rule as a dependency (see example below).</td></tr><tr><td>$(NAME)</td><td>This is the main rule, it has for target the name of the executable we want to create and it will link all object files in an executable.</td></tr><tr><td>%.o: %.c</td><td>This rule is not required in the 42 Norm but makes reading the Makefile much easier.<br>This rule has for target any .o file, and for dependency the .c file with the same name.</td></tr><tr><td>clean</td><td>This rule is a simple cleaning rule that will delete all object files created during the build process, but leave the created executable untouched.</td></tr><tr><td>fclean</td><td>This rule is also a cleaning rule, it is dependent on the <em>clean</em> rule to delete all object files. Once all object files are deleted, this rule will delete the created executable.</td></tr><tr><td>re</td><td>This rule will rebuild everything, it is dependent on the <em>fclean</em> rule, which deletes every object file and the executable.<br>Once all the object files and the executable are deleted, the <em>re</em> rule calls the <em>all</em> rule to rebuild everything.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<details>

<summary>Simple Makefile respecting the convention (everything described)</summary>

{% code title="Makefile" lineNumbers="true" %}
```makefile
# This Makefile example contains some variables and automatic variables
# Below is the same Makefile without the variables and automatic variables
# NAME is a variable containing the name of the executable
# we want to create.
NAME = excutableName

# SRC is a variable containing all .c files required to build the project
# Note that every file name has to be separated by a space and that I 
# didn't use a wildcard (*.c) to get every file.
# While the usage of a wildcard would be simpler, it is not authorized by
# the 42 Norm as it is easier to input an unwanted file in the build 
# process by simply adding it in the src folder.
SRC = main.c test.c

# OBJ is a variable containing all .o files.
# As you can see I wrote OBJ := and not OBJ =
# The difference between := and = is that = is an assignement like we know
# in C. := tells make to append the result to the variable
# We have to append the result because what's on the right will be run for
# every .c file
# Whats on the right basically means : "for every .c file you find in the
# SRC variable, give me the corresponding .o file".
# This will then append the result for each .c file to the OBJ variable.
# It simply replaces the .c in each files in the SRC variable by .o
OBJ := $(SRC:%.c=%.o)

# ALL is the first rule in the Makefile, making it the default rule when
# calling the make command without specifying the rule.
# As said in the description table above, this rule has the $(NAME) rule
# as dependency and will therefore, call the $(NAME) rule
all: $(NAME)

# $(NAME) is, as said above, the main rule of the Makefile.
# This rule has the OBJ variable as dependency, which means, if one or
# more .o files are missing, make will try to build them (if a rule for
# that exists) before running the $(NAME) commands. 
# When all the dependency are there, the commands will be executed.
# This commande takes two automatic variables, $^ and $@
#
# $^: The name of all the prerequisites, with space between them
# $@: This corresponds to the name of the target, in this case this will
#    be executableName.
$(NAME): $(OBJ)
    gcc -Wextra -Wall -Werror $^ -o $@

# %.o rule will compile one .c file to its correspondig object (.o) file
# The %.o: %.c pattern specifies that in order to build something whose
# file name ends with .o, you need to have a file that has the same prefix
# but then ends with .c rather than .o.

# What it does is run the rm -f shell command followed by the content of

# This results in all the .o files being deleted.
clean:

# FCLEAN rule has as prerequisite the CLEAN rule, which means that the

# library because it has the name $(NAME)
fclean: clean

### Variables naming convention

There's a rule convention, for which rules are expected in every Makefile, and there's also a naming convention for variable. I'll describe here the variables that are expected in a Makefile, and explain why it's named this way for the ones that are not very clear.

<table><thead><tr><th width="172">Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>NAME</td><td>The buid target name (executable / library / other)</td></tr><tr><td>CC</td><td>This variable contains the compiler<br>gcc for C<br>g++ for C++</td></tr><tr><td>CCFLAGS</td><td>This variable contains the compiler flags.<br>i.e. for 42 we have to use -Wall -Werror -Wextra</td></tr><tr><td>CPPFLAGS</td><td>This variable contains the compiler preprocessor flags.<br>i.e. : <br>-I to specify the include directory (see complete examples below)<br>-D MACRO=value to define a macro at compiling time (used in Get Next Line)</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that CPPFLAGS doesn't mean it's the C++ compiler flags, here the "PP" part stands for PreProcessor
{% endhint %}

### Automatic variables

There's a lot of so-called _automatic variables_ that you can use in your Makefiles, I'll describe and explain (with examples) only the most used ones (=> the ones that will be the most useful for you in the 42 Cursus).

<table><thead><tr><th width="193">Automatic vairable</th><th>Descrption</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>$@</td><td>The file name of the target of the rule.</td></tr><tr><td>$&#x3C;</td><td>The name of the first prerequisite.</td></tr><tr><td>$?</td><td>The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with spaces between them.<br>If the target does not exist, all prerequisites will be included.</td></tr><tr><td>$^</td><td>The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find more specific descriptions for Automatic Variables here :\

### Complete Makefile example (EXECUTABLE)

Here under I will write a complete Makefile to compile an executable as well as describing each steps (as I for the simple Makefile).

# Whats on the right basically means : "for every .c file you find in the

# ARNAME : ar rcs $(NAME)
# RANNAME : ranlib $(NAME)
bonus: $(OBJS_BASBO)
    $(ARNAME) $(OBJS_BASBO)

# The bonus rule works the same way as the $(NAME) rule but instead of
# having the OBJS variable as dependency, it has the OBJS_ALL variable.
# Since the OBJS_ALL variable contains the OBJS, the BONUS_OBJS and the

# are dependencies for this everything rule.
# The commands are what is described above in the variable declaration

everything: $(OBJS_ALL)

### .PHONY targets

A phony target is a target that is not really the name of a file. It's just a name for a recipe to be executed when you make an explicit reuquest (i.e `make clean`).

There are two reasons to use a phony target :

* To avoid a conflict with a file of the same name.
* To improve performance.

If you write a rule whose recipe will not create the target file, the recipe will be executed every time the target comes up for remaking. Here is example :&#x20;

{% code title="Makefile" lineNumbers="true" %}
```makefile
clean:
    rm -f *.o
```
{% endcode %}

Because the rm command does not create a file named clean, probably no such file will ever exist.

Therefore, the rm command will be executed every time you say `make clean`.

In this example, the clean target will not work as expected if a file named clean is ever created in this directory. Since it has no prerequisites, clean would always be considered up to date and its recipe would not be executed.

To avoid this problem, you can explicitly declare the target to be phony by making it a prerequisite of the special .PHONY target as follows :

```
.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -f *.o
```

Once this is done, `make clean` will run the recipe regardless of whether there is a file named clean.
