If you are like me and **you know nothing about computers**, <mark style="color:green;">welcome!</mark>&#x20;

When I read the B2BR topic for the first time I was completely lost and didn't know where to start... lol. I will try my best to make sure you are not as lost as I was. And don't forget: try to understand what you are doing as much as possible :)&#x20;



**So... Let's dive into a brand new topic, which has not much to do with C programming anymore**



We will first review all the (unknown) terms used in the subject. The goal is to understand what we are doing and be able to use this knowledge to build our virtual machine. We will then install our virtual machine and start by doing what is required in the subject.



{% hint style="warning" %}
For this project you will not only be evaluated on the creation of your virtual machine, but you will also be evaluated on theoretical elements (definitions & concepts). So make sure you understand everything !
{% endhint %}
