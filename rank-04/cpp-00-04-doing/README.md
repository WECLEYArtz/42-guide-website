# CPP (00 - 04) (doing)

Before diving into the core of these five first C++ modules let's first understand the basics of what is C++ and more specifically what is _Object Oriented Programming_ (OOP).

Also, I encourage you to look at the videos on the Intra before going further, each subject has its own video explaining it.

### What is object oriented programming ?

To start, I'll let you read [this](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP) article from _TechTarget_.

This article is a good starting point, but it's only a starting point, it contains a lot of words and topics that you can search to get a better understanding of everything.

### What is C++ ?

First of all, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNeX4EGtR5Y) short video introduction of C++.&#x20;

[Here](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp) is a complete introduction C++ guide / tutorial on **w3schools.**

I encourage you to read through it, you don't need to remember all the details but at least read through it so you can store in your head the basic principles and ideas of C++ to go search for them in more details again when you need / encounter them when doing the different exercises.

### C++ Modules

C++ is composed of 10 modules, splitted on two circles, the five firsts modules are on this rank (00-04), and the five lasts are on the next rank (05-09).

All the C++ modules work the same way as the C modules did during your pisicine, each module is splitted into multiple exercises. Some of the modules can be validated by doing 80% of the module, and other require 100%, like in the piscine.

### C++ on this GitBook

For most of the modules, I won't go into the details of each and every exercises in these modules. I'll go over the main topics that are present on the first page of the subjects.

Some of the modules, the more complex ones, will be a little more described with some examples and all, but that would do a lot to write if I described every exercises in details.
