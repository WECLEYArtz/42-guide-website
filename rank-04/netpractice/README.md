# NetPractice

Okay - let's put the code aside for a second and get down to something mystical: networks.

* How do two machines communicate with each other?
* What is the Internet anyway?
* Do you even know what an IP address is?

All these network-related questions can be answered to perfection thanks to NetPractice, a project from 42.



### NetPractice in short

What you'll have to do:

* Download a file from your intra site

Once that's done, you're going to have some fun with a few problem-solving games:

* You'll need to configure small networks. To do this, you'll need to understand how addressing works with the TCP/IP protocol. (You'll have 10 levels)

Here's an example:

The aim is to link all the machines in each level.

It sounds easy enough, but if you're not an expert, it can be hard to find the information you need.&#x20;
